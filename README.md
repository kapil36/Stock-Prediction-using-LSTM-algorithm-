# Stock-Prediction-using-LSTM-algorithm-
Stock Price Forecast using Python's Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Model. One form of recurrent neural network used to learn order dependency in sequence prediction issues is called Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The LSTM is particularly effective at forecasting stock values because it can store historical data. Firstly, one should put return_sequences = True for multiple LSTM layers so that the output can then be provided to the next layer. Secondly, to improve the accuracy, I consistently added dropout layers after each LSTM layer that would help to reduce overfitting, something which neural networks are highly prone to. In this project I selected stocks of 5 FMCG companies which are ITC, Nestle, Hindustan Unilever, Britannia and Marico.
